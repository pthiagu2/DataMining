% 
% This file is a plain text export of a portion of the temperature data contained 
% in Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Analysis.
% 
% The associated dataset name is shown above, while this file should have the 
% name
% 
% 	station_change.txt
% 
% For general information about this data product, please refer to the data set 
% readme file: README.txt
% 
% The current file contains some information on when temperature stations are 
% known or suspected to have changed.  Currently, the only type of change 
% recorded here is changes in station location. The main temperature data, other 
% secondary data, and station metadata can be found in other files in the same 
% directory and should be distributed together.
% 
% The columns contained in this file are as follows:
% 
% 	Station ID: A unique integer identifying each station.  Metadata for the site 
% is contained in the associated files labeled "site_summary" or "site_detail".
% 
% 	Change Event Number: An integer indexing the change events at each station.
% 
% 	Change Date: The approximate date at which the change occurred expressed as 
% the year and decimal fraction of a year.
% 
% 	Change Type: An integer specifying the type of change that occurred (or may 
% have occurred).  Currently, the following values are allowed:
% 
% 		1) An explicitly declared station move.  (Nearly all of these originate from 
% US stations.)
% 
% 		2) A suspected change in station location, based on the report of a new 
% station location that is inconsistent with prior location reports given the 
% precision of the prior and new report.
% 
% The station changes reported here are currently based exclusively on the 
% metadata.  In the future, we may expand this file to document suspected changes 
% based on the data as well.
% 
% It is important to note that the "change date" is based on when the change was 
% recorded in the metadata.  It is not uncommon for such changes to be recorded 
% months or even years after the change was actually executed.  In addition, some 
% apparent changes in metadata may reflect corrections to the metadata that 
% occurred without any true change in the instrumentation.  It has been estimated 
% by NOAA that only about 50% of historical station moves in the United States 
% have been explicitly documented.  It is likely that the documentation rate for 
% moves in other countries is even lower.
